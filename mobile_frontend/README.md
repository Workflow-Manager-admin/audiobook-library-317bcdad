# mobile_frontend

A new Flutter project for the Audiobook Store app.

## Features

- Browse and purchase audiobooks from a modern minimal store UI
- View your personal library of purchased books, with local storage persistence
- Listen to audiobooks in a minimalistic player screen with:
  - Skip 15 seconds forward/backward
  - Track and save playback progress per book (locally)
  - Responsive controls and progress bar
- Stripe payment integration (simulated if API key is not present)
- Modern, minimal, light theme

## Theme & Colors

- **Primary:** #1976D2 (Blue for main elements)
- **Accent:** #FFC107 (Yellow for actions and highlights)
- **Secondary:** #424242 (Grey for background/secondary elements)

## API Keys & Environment Variables

To use Stripe and any backend APIs securely, put your keys in the `.env` file located in the project root (`mobile_frontend/.env`):

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key     # Only used server-side
```

- The Flutter app will read `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` using the [flutter_dotenv](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_dotenv) package.
- **Do not commit your secret keys.**

## Local Storage

- Library and playback positions are stored using `SharedPreferences` for persistence.

## Running

1. Add your `.env` at `mobile_frontend/.env`
2. Run `flutter pub get`
3. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Stripe

- Stripe integration is simulated if no publishable key is present.
- To enable real Stripe payment, set the `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and integrate real payment flow.

## Folder Structure

- All app code is in `lib/main.dart`
- Add images and assets in `assets/`
